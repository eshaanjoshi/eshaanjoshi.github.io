# Back at it again

Hoo boy, we back in the saddle for another semester. And in the midst of the collapse of the PAC-12? How am I supposed to pay attention to classes when my favorite sports rivalries (Arizona vs the World) are being torn down around me.

Alternatively, I've had to go from cheering against UCLA to hating Texas and Oklahoma with the rest of my [Big 12 buddies](https://big12sports.com/). Pay no attention to the Wildcats behind the mirror, we've always been in the Big 12 :)

In other news, This semester is the heaviest I've taken so far, coming in at a whopping 53 FCE. I'm also a TA, a volunteer at a non-profit, and House Improvement Chair for CMU's chapter of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity.
