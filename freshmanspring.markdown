# The Freshmen Experience II - Spring 2023

I had a pretty disappointing Fall, in my eyes, so I waltzed back into CMU after winter break determined to do better.

## 15-122 Principles of Imperative Computation

After what was a heartbreaking drop last semester, I went back to this class with one goal: Do really well. 

It worked. This was the highlight of the semester for me, and learning about c0, its quirks, and how to make it work well was one of my favorite experiences. I had a lot of fun with C, and its safe to say, I love Computer Science now. 

I'm also going to be the TA for this class, God willing, starting Fall 2023.

## 36-202 Methods for Statistics and Data Science

This was another easy class that taught me the basics of R. I had a lot of fun with the last parts of it, especially the simple introductions to ML and the like.

## 66-138 Dietrich Grand Challenge Seminar

Great professors, and I learned a lot about thinking critically about my media with this one.


## 76-100 I Freshman Writing

A great writing class that made me interested in sports journalism and my professional writing minor.
