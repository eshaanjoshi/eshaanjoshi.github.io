# Introduction

My goal at CMU is to take as many courses that interest me as possible. In that sense, I'm going to be taking a lot of upper level CS, Math and Statistics courses, and I decided to document my experiences. This page will contain hyperlinks to a bunch of short articles to each semester I took here!
