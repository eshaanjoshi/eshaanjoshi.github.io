# Current/Future Work

## My Writing

I'm currently published consistently in The Tartan. I contribute to the News section, focusing on foreign policy and politics, as well as contributing to Forum, The Tartan's opinion section. I also pen the weekly satire column "Foul Play", which makes a mockery of whatever big news in going in sports at the time.

## Teaching Assistanceship

I'm currently slated to become a Teaching Assistant for CMU's [15-122 Principles of Imperative Computation][15122]
