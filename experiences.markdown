# Current/Future Work

## My Writing

I'm currently published consistently in The Tartan. I contribute to the News section, focusing on foreign policy and politics, as well as contributing to Forum, The Tartan's opinion section. I also pen the weekly satire column "Foul Play", which makes a mockery of whatever big news in going in sports at the time.

## Teaching Assistanceship

I'm currently slated to become a Teaching Assistant for CMU's [15-122 Principles of Imperative Computation][15122]


## Projects

I'm currently trying to create `Bran`, a simple interpreter and compiler for the Brainf\*ck language that will allow for step by step interpretation of a program. `Bran` is meant to help people better understand how simple Turing Machines work, and will help people get a grasp of the model of computation in a way where everything they want to do is easily viewable and accessable. Currently, a bran compiler(bfcc) and a bran interpreter (bfsh) exist, both written in the c0 language. I chose c0 because of my experience with creating a similar virtual machine interpreter for c0 in 15-122, and I wanted to try to make something similar for a simpler language.
