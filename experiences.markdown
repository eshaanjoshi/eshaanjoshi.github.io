# Past Work

## CMU Research Assistant

This was a really interesting summer project that helped me gain a deeper appreciation for the work put into HFT research. We focused on finding patterns in how Designated Market Makers split orders between multiple exchanges, and also looking into the order-splitting phenomenon and finding out how DMMs handled large call or put orders. Finally, my group packaged our findings into a presentation we gave to our professor advisor. We wrote our code in Python using the Numpy package.

## Teaching Assistanceship

I was a Teaching Assistant for CMU's [15-122 Principles of Imperative Computation][15122]

## Youth Court Initiative of Pittsburgh Junior Analyst

I served as a catch-all intern that handles website design and maintenance, research and development of outreach for the program, and also maintaining social media and web administration for the project. Youth Court Initiative hopes to bring a new civics-adjacent program to Pittsburgh Public Schools that will help educate youths on the justice system and give them information on various socioeconomic factors that affect the justice system. The program also will create youth courts within public schools as an alternative to the school punishment program to get youths involved in community justice, and put the concepts they learn in the class directly into action.

# Current/Future Work

## My Writing

I'm currently published consistently in The Tartan. I contribute to the News section, focusing on foreign policy and politics, as well as contributing to Forum, The Tartan's opinion section. I also pen the weekly satire column "Foul Play", which makes a mockery of whatever big news in going in sports at the time. 

## CMU Readme

I'm the Editor-in-Chief of a satire magazine, Readme. We're slated to publish biweekly, and we've met our deadlines. The official readme website is currently still in progress.
