# Hello! 

Hey! I'm Eshaan, and I'm a freshman at Carnegie Mellon at the time of writing this. I'm currently majoring in Statistics and Machine Learning, and minoring in Professional Writing and I'm hoping to get an additional major in Computer Science. 


# Interests

I'm interested in all things sports! I'm a big fan of [baseball][pirates] and [football][giants], and you'll catch me watching a [hockey game][penguins] here and there. I'm also interested in sports analytics and sports writing, and I currently serve as Sports Editor for the Carnegie Mellon Newspaper, *The Tartan*. You can find my articles at [my profile][thetartan].
