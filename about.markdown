# Hello! 

Hey! I'm Eshaan, and I'm a freshman at Carnegie Mellon at the time of writing this. I'm currently majoring in Statistics and Machine Learning, and minoring in Professional Writing, though I'm hoping to transfer to Computer Science by the end of my sophomore year!


# Interests

I'm interested in all things sports! I'm a big fan of [baseball][pirates] and [football][giants], and you'll catch me watching a [hockey game][penguins] here and there. I'm also interested in sports analytics and sports writing, and I currently serve as Sports Editor for the Carnegie Mellon Newspaper, *The Tartan*. You can find my articles at [my profile][thetartan].

I'm also deeply interested in Computer Science and Computer Systems. I'm currently working on several systems-related projects, and I'm hoping to learn more in the upcoming semesters.
