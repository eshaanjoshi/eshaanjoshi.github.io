# Back at it again

Hoo boy, we back in the saddle for another semester. And in the midst of the collapse of the PAC-12? How am I supposed to pay attention to classes when my favorite sports rivalries (Arizona vs the World) are being torn down around me.

Alternatively, I've had to go from cheering against UCLA to hating Texas and Oklahoma with the rest of my [Big 12 buddies](https://big12sports.com/). Pay no attention to the Wildcats behind the mirror, we've always been in the Big 12 :)

In other news, This semester is the heaviest I've taken so far, coming in at a whopping 53 FCE. I'm also a TA.

## 15-251 Great Theoretical Ideas in Computer Science
I don't think I've ever enjoyed a course as much as 15-251, and I know I said that about 15-213, and while that course has a special place in my heart, I do absolutely adore 15-251. It's a course that completely rebuilt my confidence and ability to think mathematically, made me deeply interested in discrete mathematics, and taught me how to write proofs. Concepts was fun, 251 was the best parts of concepts taken to the next level. While I did struggle, I do think 15-251 was one of the most important classes I took at CMU.

## 36-315 Statistical Graphs and Visualization
I did not enjoy this class. I have no further comments. 

## 36-235 Probability and Statistical Inference I
I seriously regret not taking a math-based probability course this semester. While it would've absolutely destroyed my grade, something like 21-325 would've been significantly more exciting and impactful to my college experience. However, I started teaching myself probability theory and mathematical probability on my own after this course.

## 15-150 Functional Programming
Incredible course, to be honest. I do consider SML to be an incredibly fun language to write code in, even if I consider Ocaml's environment to be more than a little easier to use. 150 made me want to use recursion in all my programs, and also got me interested in Programming Language research and the theories behind them. I also really did enjoy some of the proofs, though I wish they were a little less annoying sometimes.
