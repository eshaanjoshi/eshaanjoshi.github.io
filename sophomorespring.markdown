# Guess who's back (back again)

Remember when last semester was bad? It did not get any better. Sophomore fall was, on the whole, rather disappointing. I wish I'd done better, but I did enjoy half my classes and I didn't hate anything as much as I could've. My biggest mistake was probably dropping a GenEd to focus on courses that interested me, as well as taking applied statistics instead of probability theory. Regardless, we got through it, and I wound deciding spring was going to be a semester I actually enjoyed.
