# The Freshman Experience - Fall 2022

Honestly, there's not much that can prepare you for what your freshman year at CMU can be. If you're not carefull, Fall can hit you like a ton of bricks, and well, mine did.

## 21-127 Concepts of Mathematics

This was by far my favorite course. I really liked the professor, and while I struggled with the first half of the coursework, thanks to the TAs and the instructing, I was able to do really well to close out the semester. I had a great time, and I'm really glad I took it early. Concepts also got me interested in doing 15-251 Great Theoretical Ideas in Computer Science, and hopefully 15-354 Computation and Discrete Math

## 21-259 Calculus in Three Dimensions

Surprisingly, this one was a breeze. I hadn't had the best calculus education in high school, but the first two thirds of this class was incredibly easy. The latter third was much more difficult, but thanks to a combination of instructor notes, [OpenStax][stax] and tutoring, I understood the material really well. 

## 84-362 Dipomacy and Statecraft

My favorite Gen-Ed requirement in freshman year, I had a lot of fun dissecting different parts of the global political environment and different methods of diplomacy.

## 80-100 Introduction to Philosophy

My favorite parts of this class were the bits where we dipped into formal logic and proofs :) Safe to say, I'm excited to try to take 80-211 Logic and Mathematical Inquiry.

## 15-122 Principles of Imperative Computation

This class was just a bridge too far. After getting seriously ill in the leadup to the first midterm, and realizing that I was way too spread out to handle my workload, I dropped 15-122. There [is a success story]({}) about this course though...
