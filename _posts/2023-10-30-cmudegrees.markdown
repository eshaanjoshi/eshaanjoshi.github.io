Carnegie Mellon has done a lot of reshuffling and changing in their degree programs in the last few years, culminating in a degree landscape that can seem different for those who graduated a few years ago. The university has been expanding in an attempt to gather more students, or give students the ability to tailor their major for better information.

Firstly, some of the changes: Economics in the last few months has been fully transferred into Tepper, and the economics program seems to be fully integrated with the School of Business. It's an interesting change, but has also helped keep the resources the program uses together in order to best serve students.

The most exciting change for many is the addition of the new [Bachelor of Science in Robotics](https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2023/september/carnegie-mellon-university-launches-bachelor-of-science-in-robotics) now offered by the Robotics Institute and the School of Computer Science. The degree seems distinct from the average CS degree, with requirements leaning away from theoretical (there appears to be no requirement to take 15-150, 15-210, or 15-451) and far more practical, with several IDeATe courses and other various coursework encouraged.

The program also encourages students to focus on design and production of various different robotics systems. Considering Carnegie Mellon is part of the group that is about to put a [rover on the Moon](https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2023/october/cmus-iris-moonark-leave-pittsburgh-en-route-to-the-moon), this new degree program hopes to capture some of that interest and bring new robotics funding to the city and the university. 

Also within the Engineering Department, an additional major called Engineering Design, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship has been introduced this year. This additional major seeks to create engineers who have the knowledge and skills to innovate products and become change makers. According to the [major website,](https://www.cmu.edu/iii/undergrad-edie/) "EDIE students will have expertise in technology and the ability to design, develop, and deliver economically viable solutions to the real-world challenges of today and tomorrow."

In graduate offerings, Carnegie Mellon appears to be experimenting with a new Masters of Statistics degree, which is being trial run right now. It’s another broad change, as Carnegie Mellon has only had a Ph.D. program for statistics and this could be a radical change offered to many stats undergraduates. (With Stat/ML being such a popular major, this could also lead to new five-year programs and the like for many people in Dietrich.)

Tepper will also be adding the new [MS in Management](https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2023/september/the-tepper-school-to-offer-new-master-of-science-in-management-degree) degree this year. This 10-month program will be offered next fall and will focus on finance, operations, or marketing for high-potential graduate students. The program’s development is meant to embrace flexibility and will synthesize different fields. 

Carnegie Mellon has also added new [certificate programs](https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2023/august/cmu-launches-new-online-graduate-certificate-programs) in AI, bioprinting and biofabrication, and computational data science, three fields currently experiencing significant growth. The new AI program will include coursework on ML algorithms used in day-to-day modeling, while the biofabrication coursework will help students learn to convert a regular run of the mill 3D printer and convert it into something capable of producing biological materials. The data science program will help prepare students to understand how to handle some of the complexities of a suite of tools used to deal with big data in the current environment.
