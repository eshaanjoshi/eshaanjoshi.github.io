The Frick Pittsburgh art museum in Point Breeze, set to present various artworks from the Middle East, is in hot water after it postponed an exhibit of Islamic art following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Initially scheduled to open in November, the exhibit, "Treasured Ornament: 10 Centuries of Islamic Art," was delayed due to an "unforeseen scheduling conflict." However, it appears that the postponement was prompted by concerns that displaying art from Islamic regions during wartime might cause controversy in the community.

Officially, the delay was due to concern over potential insensitivity amidst the Israel-Hamas War and aimed to avoid trauma for the community. Director Elizabeth Barker highlighted the exhibition's timing as potentially "insensitively superficial" amid heightened tensions in the Middle East.

Christine Mohamed, who represents the Council on American-Islamic Relations, criticized The Frick's decision. She said she was disheartened that the postponement implied connecting Islamic tradition with terrorism. However, the museum maintained that the postponement wasn't politically motivated but rather aimed to ensure the exhibition resonated positively with the community. 

In a comprehensive website statement, ** can we link?** the museum said it began planning the exhibit years ago. With the unforeseen Israel-Hamas War, the Frick wrote that the current show lacked essential historical context and regional community involvement, stating, "it would have been impossible to predict that war would erupt in the Middle East during the time of this show, prompting widespread heartbreak and mounting social tension."

Christine Mohamed, representing the Council on American-Islamic Relations, acknowledged the museum's intention behind delaying the exhibit and expressed compassion for the lives lost in the Israel-Hamas War. Stressing that the exhibited artwork predates the contemporary conflict, dating back to the 19th century or earlier, she urged the Frick to reconsider its decision. Mohamed argued against linking Islamic art with current political situations.
