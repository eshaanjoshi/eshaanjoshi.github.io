The Nobel Prize, named after famed stuff-blower-upper Alfred Nobel, winners were recently announced, and I want to talk about it. Honestly, one of my biggest issues with science right now is the lack of partisanship and team-based politics. It’s hard to pay attention to things if I don’t have lovable underdogs to root for, and evil empires to prey on the downfall off, and honestly, if physicists were willing to get their heads out of their books and start a pay-per-view boxing match to decide who was the smartest, I think I’d spend a lot more time thinking about their subject instead of which flavor of crayon tastes the best. (It’s red. I will be taking no comments or questions.)

Since scientists are so unwilling to throw the gauntlet and defend their ideas to the death, I guess I’ll just have to start making my own fandoms and Nobel Lore, starting this year. So here’s my bias in the 2023 Nobel Prize winners!

Firstly, man oh man, what a doozy, the Nobel Prize in Medicine. Now, I know, I know, I don’t know if the Nobel Prize has put out an official statement on whether or not Covid was bad, but they gave the award to a pair of scientists from Sweden, Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman, and their [contributions to the mRNA sequencing and modifications](https://nobelprize.org/uploads/2023/10/press-medicineprize2023-3.pdf) that made creating the Covid vaccine significantly easier. As a proud hater of the 'rona, I’m not sure I can disagree with this pick. They done did good, and I’m very glad I can pretend Covid isn’t real anymore, just like Carnegie Mellon. 

Grade: A

Now, for the controversial takes. I cannot believe they stole the Physics prize from my boy Peter Shor, from a small tech school in Cambridge, MA. Shor did some incredible work on [building the foundations of **Quantum Computing theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm), including forming a new prime-factoring algorithm. He’s got the skills and raw brilliance to be a generational talent, and the Nobel Snub is gonna be one of the biggest stories of the year, I’m sure. Shor’s work is foundational to a brand new developing field, and these yokels passed him over for…

[Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz and Anne L’Huillier](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2023/10/press-physicsprize2023.pdf) for making fast blinky lights. Sure, they’ll be really useful for trying to understand the things electrons can do in materials, something which could have massive discoveries down the line, but are you really gonna give them the prize over the hackerman from MIT?

Grade: 0 stars #justiceforshor

[Chemistry, on the other hand](https://apnews.com/article/nobel-prize-chemistry-stockholm-cabca0d16dc33427799886a1f012effe), was straightforward. Moungi G. Bawendi, Louis E. Brus and Alexei I. Ekimov did some incredibly interesting and exciting work on generating incredibly tiny “quantum dots” capable of application in several fields, including medical imaging. These dots can shine very brightly, which would give them many applications that could be incredibly powerful in many fields, and honestly, put the word “quantum” in front of anything and I’m a sucker for it, so I’m giving this one the highly prized ranking of 1 Quantum out of 0.

[Jon Fosse took home the Literary Nobel](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/oct/05/jon-fosse-wins-the-2023-nobel-prize-in-literature), and his massive repertoire of plays make him one of the most performed contemporary playwrights, and his incredible contributions to his field make him a sureshot for this award. Fosse is also the second most published Swedish playwright, another incredible feat for a man whose minimalist and introspective plays have achieved so much praise. Good job Nobel Committee, you faceless group of people. 

Now can someone please teach me Norwegian so I can appreciate this man’s work?

For the Nobel prize in economics, strikes hit this one too :/ It hasn’t been revealed yet, as the Nobel Award Winner-Pickers Union waits for better food and little tiny sandwiches from the Nobel Foundation.

The Nobel Peace Prize was given to Narges Mohamaddi, an incredibly important figure in Iran’s current feminist struggle, and someone who was unfortunately unable to make it to the awards due to her jailing by the Iranian government. Mohamaddi is a very influential figure, and possibly one of the great figures of Iranian history, and her work and protests and actions in the country, people hope, are a good sign for things to come.
