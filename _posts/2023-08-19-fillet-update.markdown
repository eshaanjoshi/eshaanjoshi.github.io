# Rust, Fillet, and other unsorted lists

Okay, so I wound up working a *lot* with rust to write Fillet, and mind you, this is a language I'd never used before. While I'd never used rust before, the more I use the language, the more fun it's become. I'm really enjoying this project, and once I'm done with both implementations from the book, I hope to continue modifying the Fillet language.

Also the files are appended .fl and that's just fun :)


## Progress on Fillet

This has been a pretty slow project, so as of today, I'm done with the entire parser, and can now break my code into tokens, which is a great first step. Not interesting to anyone but me, but I am enjoying it a lot.
