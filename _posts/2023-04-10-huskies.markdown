The UConn Huskies took home the Naismith March Madness trophy this year, after a 76-59 drubbing of San Diego State University in Houston on April 9. SDSU's offense was anemic this game, trailing by 12 points by the half, and never really recovering. UConn brought everything, shooting 43.4 percent on field goals, and 35.3 from the three point line, making 23 of 53 attempts. The game caps off another dominant season for the Huskies, winning six games in commanding fashion in the tournament this year. They've won five titles with three head coaches since 1999, remaining undefeated in the March Madness Finals. Their five titles tie them with Duke and Indiana for fourth most of all-time.
