TEXAS IS MOTHA FUCKIN BACK Y’ALL

That’s it, hell has frozen over, the Leafs are gonna win the Stanley Cup. Dogs and cats will marry in the streets, Tennessee fans will stop being annoying. Steven “Seven Win Sark but one of ‘em is @Alabama!” Sarkisian did it, after bringing the entirety of college football dangerously close to a riot last year. The man dragged his team into the belly of the beast, and whooped Alabama so bad the fans thought the Civil War was right back on. Saban is washed. Alabama will never threaten college football again. The Longhorns took ‘em out behind the woodchipper and made sure nobody would be able to identify the body. 

Yes, I’m saying all of this about a two-score loss in week two. It’s Ala-goddamn-bama, people are gonna take whatever it is they can get.

And yes, a whole lotta other stuff happened in college ball last week, but I gotta focus on the big ones. TCU and SMU decided to cancel their yearly “Do you know who my daddy is?” bowl game, and promptly after that the Christians in Texas got their ass handed to them by Colorado and Texas State. I’m not sure what happened to Baylor and TCU but man it’s fun watching Lone Star teams crash and burn.

Undefeated Colorado is absolutely the story of the season, though. After Coach Prime brought the entirety of Jackson State to a known powerhouse, the University of Colorado, the Buffs managed to beat TCU, Nebraska, and then held on against regional dynasty, Colorado State. I’m honestly impressed with what Prime has done, he figured out the best way to make a 1-11 roster better was to get a new roster that wouldn’t go 1-11. I’m not sure why more teams don’t try this. Are they stupid? 

Cal, please hire me. I can fix you.

Still, Colorado hasn’t played the toughest of opponents, outside of whoever decided that it was in CSU’s best interest to commit enough penalties to make the refs hit their yearly quotas. Nearly 200 yards of penalty yardage, I’m not sure how that’s possible. There are Big 10 teams that haven’t seen that kind of offensive yardage in history, and if Ferentz could figure out how to make penalty baiting a part of his defense, Iowa would become undefeatable. 

Meanwhile, the damn PAC-12, after having gone down to two damn teams, is somehow one of the best conferences in the entire sport. We have like, six teams ranked, U$C is back in spoiled rich kid form, and somehow Oregon and Washington are also good. The entire damn conference, top to bottom is about to show the world what we’re made of, and then just turn to shit and collapse. People are trying to tell me watching CSU v CU go to 2OT and 2:00 a.m. isn’t worth it, but if I don’t have PAC-12 after dark, I’m not really sure what the point of college football even is.

If you want to watch something crazy happen, I think this is the season for you. We’re gonna have an absolute blast speculating and watching fans get their hopes up before Georgia wins the whole damn thing one more time.
