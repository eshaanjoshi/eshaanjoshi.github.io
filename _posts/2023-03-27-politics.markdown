Last week, former president Donald Trump announced on his own social media platform, [Truth Social](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/18/us/politics/trump-indictment-arrest-protests.html), that “THE FAR & AWAY LEADING REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE AND FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WILL BE ARRESTED ON TUESDAY OF NEXT WEEK. PROTEST, TAKE OUR NATION BACK!” This comes on the heels of rumors that New York prosecutors planned to charge Trump over his involvement in the [hush money payments](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/3/24/donald-trumps-stormy-daniels-case-heres-what-you-need-to-know) to porn star Stormy Daniels, via his lawyer Michael Cohen. This prediction has yet to bear any fruit, as no prosecutors in the state or borough have made moves regarding his case. The former president demanded that his supporters protest or make themselves heard, another in the long history of ‘calls to action’ that he has had in his time in the public spotlight.

However, the news about the former president’s predicted arrest seems to be less indicative of fear and more of spectacle. [Some anonymous sources are reporting](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/22/trump-wants-to-be-handcuffed-for-court-appearance-in-stormy-daniels-case-sources-say) that the president wants to be in handcuffs when he is in the courtroom for the case. It appears that the celebrity-turned-president wants to continue the theatrics that made him famous, and making up a fake arrest is certainly a method to keep people’s eyes on his situation. 

After a rally in Waco, Texas, [Trump also alleged](https://www.axios.com/2023/03/26/trump-suggests-da-dropped-stormy-case) that District Attorney Alvin Bragg had dropped the case, citing that the case itself was fraudulent. The former president has reiterated criticisms for his former attorney, Michael Cohen, and denies any and all involvement with Daniels. Bragg has made no moves on the case, and his office continues to state that they will apply the law fairly and evenly. Running into Trump’s Tuesday prediction for the arrest, Trump also amassed a significant amount of money with the statement, raising, according to some sources, [$1.5 million in the few days after the announcement.](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-raised-million-days-after-posting-arrest-inidctment-truth-social-2023-3) The approximately $500,000 he made per day for the three days was double what he’s been passively fundraising in the past year for his 2024 presidential bid, though there is no information on where this money is going or for what purpose it is being used.

Joe Tapocina, an attorney for Trump, [claims that the post was based on what Trump saw in the media.](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/18/politics/donald-trump-manhattan-da-arrest-protests/index.html) He argued that the DA’s lack of explanation or public statements on the case were problematic, and that he, and his client, were currently in the dark about what was going on in Manhattan. It should be noted that informing a defendant of whether charges will or won’t be filed is not a necessity, nor is it required of the courts. This is different from discovery, the process by which a prosecution is required to share its evidence with the defense. As the former president has not been charged yet, similar burdens are not placed on the DA’s office.

Meanwhile, it appears one more witness is to be called in the case against Trump’s monetary mishandlings, which may shed more light on what happened between him and Daniels. It is not known whether this is the last witness or whether the grand jury in charge of the indictment process will continue to listen to testimony before they make their decision. Should this be the last witness, the grand jury will have the right to decide whether the case against Trump should proceed or not. In the case they do, he will be indicted, at which point Trump would officially be the defendant of an investigation and face more severe repercussions and rules. 
	
The Manhattan DA's office has not made further comments at this time.
