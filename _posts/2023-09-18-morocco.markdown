On Sept. 9, a [magnitude 7.2 earthquake](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/magnitude-7-earthquake-strikes-morocco-gfz-2023-09-08/) struck Morocco, causing widespread damage in and around the city of Marrakesh. According to recent reports, over 2,900 people have died and hundreds of thousands have been affected by the calamity. It’s one of the largest earthquakes to hit the country in over 50 years, destroying a huge amount of crucial infrastructure and sending first responders and humanitarian groups scrambling to help.

Destructive earthquakes are rare for Morocco, and the country did not have the infrastructure to handle the disaster. Many small villages and towns near Marrakesh have seen huge death tolls. With their lines of communication cut during the disaster, many found it difficult to get help in time. 

While Morocco recovers, humanitarian efforts are underway from the U.S. and other countries around the world. Many have offered to send aid to Morocco. Israel ordered its [military](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/le-monde-africa/article/2023/09/12/morocco-earthquake-israeli-ngos-are-among-those-on-the-ground_6133536_124.html) to prepare to send humanitarian aid to the affected country. It’s a big step forward in Israel-Morocco relations, especially as the two countries normalized relationships in 2020. With Israel’s medical expertise, this could be a huge step in minimizing further loss of life as the country recovers.

Algeria opened its airspace to Morocco for humanitarian aid after decades of tensions between the two nations. This comes as a major change in policy for Algeria, one that could prove life-saving as more supplies are flown in to help the population in the aftermath.

Morocco’s king has remained distanced from the country, especially as further progress is made on reconstruction and rescue attempts. With the country reeling, [King Mohammed VI](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/moroccos-king-keeps-regal-distance-even-earthquake-crisis-2023-09-15/) has spent much of his time keeping a low profile. He’s made only a few public appearances, to hospitals, and also made an impassioned cry for people across the country to donate blood.
