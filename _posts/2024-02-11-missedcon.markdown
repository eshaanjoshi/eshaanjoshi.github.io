As someone whoâ€™s always in favor of love being in the air, and since a celebration of Valentineâ€™s Day is sometime in the near future, I wanted to bring the readership of The Tartan some joy: the endless lovesickness of totally real people who submitted their tragedies to me, your local matchmaker and sports editor.

Dec. 3, 2023: 

*To my 122 TA. if I say ur hot can u plz give me an A? Ik ur desperate and im desperate too, letâ€™s make smth happen?*

I contacted the submitter to ask if this worked. They refused to comment, saying they had to finish images before the end of the day.

Jan. 13:

*To the guy sobbing on the way back to his dorm. I like your shoes, do you want to stepâ€”*

We had to cut this one off. If youâ€™re the lucky guy who spent his early January sobbing, well, I guess you have a secret admirer on campus. Good luck?

Feb. 1:

*Why do people keep posting stuff to the missed connections page? This shit doesnâ€™t work*

Go to hell, you soulless, love-hating, piece of garbage. 

Dec. 20, 2023:

*Is he hot or is it just the airport?*

Itâ€™s the airport. Itâ€™s the airport. Itâ€™s the airport. Itâ€™s the airport.

Dec. 21, 2023: 

*Airport guy said he loves me ðŸ™‚*

Pour one out for the follow-up. Iâ€™ll take the under on two days before it falls apart.

Aug 30, 2023:

*To the guy with the hair, and the glasses I think who wears shirts and stuff, I think ur pretty (: text me? I want u*

Guys, any of you have hair, glasses, and shirts? Oh? All of you? Câ€™mon yâ€™all, be a little more specific when you send me these bad boys. Add some details.

Nov. 13, 2023:

*To the incredibly hot person on campus, do you wanna date me??? :3*

WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO? SERIOUSLY. WHO. USE YOUR WORDS. ADD SOME DETAILS.

Sept. 22, 2023:

*To the guy in the green hoodie, hex code #00ff00, with the black shoes purchased on the fourth of last october, with the social security number 90430934, do you want to maybe meet :3*

Not that specific, Jesus.

Oct. 3, 2023:

*To the guy who I follow to class every day, I promise Iâ€™m nice ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ stop running away!!! and calling the cops!!! I just wanna watch u sleep!!!!*

I have nothing to add to this one.

Those are all the ones we can publish. The rest I canâ€™t sneak into pillbox, no matter how much I beg my editor.
