# I love rust!

So, yeah, last time I was here I said rust was kinda cool, but hoo boy, rust has rapidly become my favorite language. I'm not sure what I'd do with it, right now, but it's so much fun :)

Now, obviously I have to learn how to write *good* rust instead of just writing whatever crazy code I can think of and then putting it into a file.

## A brief aside

So, I still love C, and I love C making me put in the leg work to make good code, but Rust is really making me rethink things. I also do want to start contributing to projects, but honestly I don't know how to start.

# The Fillet Update

As of right now, Fillet is currently capable of creating a abstract syntax tree for all algebraic expressions, thought it can't interpret those yet. That's, really, really cool, and I'm excited to see where it goes.

# Other updates?
Hm. I'm not sure if I'm doing anything terribly interesting right now. Looking for ways to improve my resume, and I might start posting analytic pieces if I get back into sports analytics in a big way.

### A second, briefer, aside
