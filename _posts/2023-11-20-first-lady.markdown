On Nov. 8, Jill Biden traveled to Mill 19 to highlight the importance of new manufacturing. Industrial areas such as Mill 19 are crucial in keeping America’s competitive edge in the technology sector. Dr. Biden held a roundtable with several major members of the Pittsburgh community, including Mayor Ed Gainey, and was accompanied by Secretory of Labor Julie Su.

Mill 19 will host several new research hubs, including the Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing, CMU’s own Manufacturing Futures Institute, Catalyst Connections, and Aptiv. These groups have been steadily moving into the site for the last few years, with more to come, given sufficient funding. In May, Pittsburgh was named one of the Biden Administration’s [five Workforce Hubs](https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2023/november/flotus-touts-pittsburgh-as-workforce-hub-at-cmus-mill-19), along with Augusta, Columbus, Phoenix, and Baltimore. 

Undergraduate Student Senate president Kyle Hynes attended the event and said the conversation focused on the big changes and emergent technologies that are coming out of the research hubs. The United States has been investing heavily in new R&D, and that investment money has been distributed significantly into Pittsburgh. Mill 19, when combined with other governmental funding, will make Pittsburgh one of the most important robotics centers in the world. This comes alongside Carnegie Mellon embracing robotics development with their new Bachelors in Robotics.

Gainey was also excited about the future of Pittsburgh, especially in the forecasted growth in the city due to the new installations. Gainey reminded people that the city would become far more nationally relevant thanks to the investment, and that this would revitalize much of the industry in this part of the Rust Belt.

Funding from the Department of Defense, with $80 million towards ARM, as well as a new dedicated space, will give many research groups the ability to engage in rapid prototyping and continuously keep their development running, instead of having to outsource much of the creation part of the design process to other places. With new development, new industry, and new firms entering the city to continue their research, Mill 19 will bring significant change to the Pittsburgh landscape.
