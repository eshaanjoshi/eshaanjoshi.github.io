On June 18, 2023, [Hardeep Singh Nijjar,](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/22/india-canada-row-sikh-killing-diplomatic-shock-waves-hardeep-singh-nijjar) a Sikh Separatist, with alleged ties to Sikh terrorist groups, and a member of the separatist Khalistan movement, was killed by the Indian government. This would have been nothing unexpected had it not been for the location that he was killed at, in Canada.

The uproar in response to this has led to shockwaves in the international community between India and Canada, as the unlawful killing of someone in another country is a massive international relations issue. Assassination of political enemies within a country’s borders is frowned upon, but once violence spreads across nations and extradition rights are revoked, the situation gets far more dicey.

Information collected by the Anglosphere intelligence organization, [the Five Eyes,](https://time.com/6316639/canada-india-sikh-killing-surveillance/) was the first to blow a whistle on this activity, which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took to parliament in an effort to shed further light on it.

Meanwhile, India responded with the shutdown of many links between the two countries, requesting Trudeau decrease his diplomatic staff and additionally shutting down the company processing Indian visas for Canadian citizens, leading to the cutting off of thousands of people with connections to the subcontinent. This move has heralded further tit-for-tat response, as India rejects the claims Canada has made, calling them “absurd”.

India has long had a policy of pursuing separatist movement leaders within the country, and the Sikh Separatist movement, which lasted from the 70s to the 90s with broad violence, ended with the assassination of PM Indira Gandhi after her [raid on Amritsar,](https://www.india.com/news/india/operation-blue-star-a-brief-history-from-division-of-punjab-to-assassination-of-indira-gandhi-6093459/) and the subsequent riots against the Sikhs.

With India fearing a new wave of this sentiment may be on the rise, as well as the complexities in India’s current relationship with some northern border states and the various moves that the Modi Government has been pushing, the country has spent much effort on trying to clamp down on separatist movements. With Nijjar being a large figure in the separatists among the Sikh diaspora, and also trying to organize separatist votes for the Sikhs, he became a target for the country. India also alleges ties to terrorist organizations, which Nijjar denied.

India’s military intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, RAW, has become more and more emboldened in recent times, with multiple killings of high ranking enemies of the state in Pakistan. This would be RAW’s first extrajudicial actions in a Western country, something which may lead to more of a response than the frosty relationship between India and Pakistan.

India and Canada have also suspended trade talks, which may be a significant problem for the two countries.
