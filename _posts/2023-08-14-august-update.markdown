# Oh boy, it's been a while!

This website sort of stagnated, and honestly, I hope to publish way more updates towards my projects and courses here in the coming semester. I have to get into the habit of documenting my work, and I should definitely use this to help do that. 

It's wild to think I'm already done with an entire year of college. As of the writing of this post, I've taken 3 semesters of CMU, and I'm excited to see what this next semester looks like. I have over 200 units already, which is insane, I've planned a major change, and I'm falling in love with parts of the computer science experience I never thought I would. Honestly? I'm not sure what I want to focus on exactly, but I hope computer systems are going to be a big part of it.

With no further ado, here's my work for this summer:

## The Classes!

[Take a look :)]({% link freshmansummer.markdown %})

## The Internships!

I somehow pulled off two internships this summer, specifically working as a Research Intern with Chester Spatt on order splitting with designated market makers. This project culminated in a presentation, and was a pretty big commitment. 

The *other* internship started after I got reached out to by the Youth Court Initiative, who were looking for competent Teen Court veterans to help bring the program to Pittsburgh. I wound up taking a pretty big role in the founding of this non-profit. I'm currently helping create a lot of the forward facing aspect of this project, including the website, UI/UX, the social media, serving as an administrator for much of the technological backdrop, and *also* working to create the content necessary to keep the project running.

## The projects!

I got two of these I'm currently working on, and I'll be posting about them periodically

### `Fillet`

Fillet is an interpreter based on the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book. While the book is written in Java and C, I am currently rewriting the code in Rust, a language I don't know, in an effort to learn Rust, interpreters, and more.

### Reading the Linux Kernel

Man, this was a terrible idea for a project, but based on inspiration from a classmate, I'm gonna be looking through the Linux 0.0.1 kernel and trying to understand how it works and get a deeper understanding of kernel development.
