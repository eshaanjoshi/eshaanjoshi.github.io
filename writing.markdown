# Hello! 

Hey! I'm Eshaan, and I'm a freshman at Carnegie Mellon at the time of writing this. I'm currently majoring in Statistics and Machine Learning, with an intended additional major in Computer Science, and minors in Professional Writing and Robotics.


# Interests

I'm interested in all things sports! I'm a big fan of [baseball][pirates] and [football][giants], and you'll catch me watching a [hockey game][penguins] here and there. I'm also interested in sports analytics and sports writing, and I currently serve as Sports Editor for the Carnegie Mellon Newspaper, *The Tartan*. You can find my articles at [my profile][thetartan2], though with website redesigns, I've decided to add the rest of my content to this website too.

I also write outside of sports, opinion pieces, satire and short stories, though those range from unpublishable to the reckless ravings of a very sleep deprived student. I publish bits and pieces via *The Tartan*, though I'll be publishing a few independently as well as via my new publication, *KGB Presents: Readme*.

I'm also deeply interested in Computer Science and Computer Systems. I've been working more on embedded programming, and am currently working on the PIT Magic Embedded team for Carnegie Mellon's Space Robotics program. Beyond that, I have an interest in theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics, and I know at this point I have a very long list, but bear with me, I'm sure they'll all come together eventually.

# Social and Clubs

I'm currently treasurer for the [Carnegie Mellon University Democrats Club][dems]. I'm a member of the Carnegie Mellon [KGB][kgb]. I have been informed, by various sources, that KGB stands for "Kevin's Gamer Boys". Further investigation is pending. I'm also a brother of the Alpha Kappa Chapter of the [Alpha Epsilon Pi][aepi] fraternity.

# Haps and Mishaps

I'm currently attempting to gain mathematical maturity by teaching myself analysis and probabiltiy, which is going exactly as well as the sinking of the *Titanic*. Chapter 1 was my iceberg and at this point my brain is rattling around in my head. It could always be worse. I could have a class on this.

# That College Down in Cleveland

As one of the four people invested in sports at Carnegie Mellon, I maintain our fierce rivalry with Case Western Reserve University. I will eventually convert my fellow students, but progress is grim. Go Tartans!
